# Coding Factory 2019: Mars Rover Testing Challenge
This is a testing challenge for candidates in Coding Factory 2019. The repository contains two files for source code and two files for tests. The aim is to write the code implementation into the source files so that the tests can pass.

### Setup
- Setup editor with two panels open, one for source file and one for the test file
- Open a terminal instance and navigate to this repository
- Run tests in watch mode by executing `npm test`
- Guide when necessary and see the magic happen!

(Tests should be written in JavaScript. ES6 syntax can be used.)
